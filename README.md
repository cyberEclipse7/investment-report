# Investment Report Console App

This is a small C# console app that simulates how a financial company might communicate investment returns to a customer.

## What the program does

The program:

- Takes customer and investment data (products, shares, returns, and profits)
- Formats percentages, currency, and numbers properly
- Aligns everything into clean, readable, report-style output
- Prints a friendly investment comparison letter to the console

## Focus

It focuses on one thing:  **turning raw financial data into something that looks professional and human-readable.**
